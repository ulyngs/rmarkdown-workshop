# Section references
## Another test header
### A sub test header

Now, let me refer to section \@ref(section-references).

I notice that under section  \@ref(another-test-header) we have a sub-subsection, namely section \@ref(a-sub-test-header).

In the next section, we have defined an explicit ID, namely in section \@ref(my-id).

## My explicit header ID {#my-id}


# Figure references
**GOTCHA**: Figures must have captions - otherwise they won't be assigned labels. This is because there's otherwise nothing to refer to!

## Images
Refer to the chunk label with the syntax `\@ref(fig:label)`.

```{r captain, fig.cap="A marvellous meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/captain.jpeg")
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:captain), we see a great reference meme.

## Plots
Like images (generated plots are auomatically saved as images before they're included in the output): refer to the chunk label with the syntax `\@ref(fig:label)`.

```{r pressure, fig.cap="Under pressure"}
plot(pressure)
```

In Figures \@ref(fig:pressure) we see a plot of volcanic pressure.

## Tables
Refer to the chunk label with the syntax `\@ref(tab:label)`.

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],
            caption="Some stopping distances for cars")
```

In Table \@ref(tab:cars) we see a few stopping distances at various speeds for various cars.

## Text references
If you need to use fancy syntax within your caption, you might need to either watch your escaping of characters in the figure caption, or do so with a [text reference](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references) - otherwise `knitr` will be confused.

So the reference for Figure \@ref(fig:pressure-no-text-ref) requires an extra back-slash to do what we want.

```{r pressure-no-text-ref, fig.cap = "Under more **pressure** than the caption shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:captain)"}
plot(pressure)
```

The alternative is to define that same piece as a text reference with `(ref:pressure-text-ref) Under more **pressure** than the caption shown in Figure \@ref(fig:captain)`, and then point the figure caption to that piece of text with `fig.cap = "(ref:pressure-text-ref)"` we get what we want. See Figure \@ref(fig:pressure-text-ref).

(ref:pressure-text-ref) Under more **pressure** than the caption shown in Figure \@ref(fig:captain)

```{r pressure-text-ref, fig.cap = "(ref:pressure-text-ref)"}
plot(pressure)
```
