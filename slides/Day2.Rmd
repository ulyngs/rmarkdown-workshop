# Customising your output

???
we'll look at this in two ways
- using YAML options to directly customise the output (you might use this for yourself or you might want to create a template that students should download and fill in)
- adopting a publisher's LaTeX (or Word) template for use with R Markdown

---
class: larger-body

## Simple customisation via YAML header

- Many simple customisation options are easily set in the YAML header

--
- The options available depend on the output format (HTML, PDF, etc.), see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html)

--
- Let's have a look at some common options...


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*   toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/html_toc.png")
```
]


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
*   toc_float: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/html_toc_float.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
* bookdown::pdf_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/pdf_toc.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
* bookdown::word_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/word_toc.png")
```
]

---
class: larger-body

### Putting content in tabs in HTML output
- Adding `{.tabset}` after a header makes its sub-headers appear in tabs instead of standalone sections.


--
.pull-left[

For example:

```markdown
# Test header {.tabset}

## Including tables

(tab content)

## Including plots

(tab content)

```

]

--
.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_tabset.png")
```

]

---
class: larger-body

## Appearance and style
- In HTML output, you can use `theme` or a custom **.css** style sheet

--
- `theme` options (see them at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/)) : *“cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “darkly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “yeti”*


--
.pull-left[
For example:
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: darkly
---
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="75%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_theme.png")
```

]

---
class: larger-body
## Appearance and style
- For fine-grained control, supply a specific template to use for the output document:

```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    template: my_template.html

  bookdown::pdf_document2:
*    template: my_template.tex

  bookdown::word_document2:
*    reference_docx: my-styles.docx #note: 'reference_docx'
---
```

- For more on HTML templates, see the [pandoc documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) and/or have a look at the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html5)
- For more on Word templates, watch this short video ([vimeo.com/110804387](https://vimeo.com/110804387)), or read this article ([rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html))

---
class: larger-body
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown

--
- The [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package contains a range of ready-made templates for paper submissions

--
- At the moment, many of the templates are not well documented, and it can be difficult to understand what's going on under the hood

--
- It's useful to know a bit about how it works, if you need to submit a paper formatted with LaTeX but want to write in R Markdown

--
- Let's have a look at the [PLOS LaTeX template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/public-library-of-science-plos)


---
## What's a LaTeX template anyway?

.pull-left[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/plos_latex.png")
```

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```

---
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown
.pull-left[
```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---
```
]


--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_error.png")
```
]

---
class: center, middle, inverse

![](figures/rmarkdownflow.png)

---
class: larger-body

## plos_latex_template.tex
- Dollar signs have special meaning for `pandoc`


--
- in the template document, `pandoc` will look for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and insert the corresponding content in your **.Rmd** file, before the output document is created


--
- `$` is escaped with another `$`


--
.pull-left[
If we take a look at line 57 in **plos_latex_template.tex** we see this:
```latex
% For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


--
.pull-right[
- We change to this:<br>
<br>

```latex
% For example, x$$^2$$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $$x^2$$ 
(or $$\mathrm{x}^2$$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]

---
class: larger-body

## plos_latex_template.tex
- Fix this throughout and we get normal compilation of the LaTeX template to PDF:


--
.pull-left[

```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template_adapted.tex
---
```

```{r, out.width="88%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figures/template_escapes.png")
```


]


--
.pull-right[

```{r, out.width = "95%"}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```
]

---
class: larger-body

## Plug in information from our **.Rmd** file
- Find the places in the LaTeX template where you want to insert content from your R Markdown document

--
- Wrap variables from your YAML header in `$`'s to insert them, e.g. `\textbf\newline{$title$}` 

--
- To insert all the content after your YAML header, type `$body$`


--
.pull-left[
```latex

# Introduction

"Tribute" is the first single of Tenacious D's self-titled debut album. 
It was released July 16, 2002.
The song is a tribute to what Gass and Black refer to as "The Greatest Song in the World" (often confused as the song's title), which Tenacious D themselves came up with, but have since forgotten. 
It was released as a downloadable track for Rock Band in addition to appearing as a playable track for Guitar Hero Live.

# Workflows, collaboration, teaching

???
- Okay, so let's talk about how r markdown fits into concrete workflows
- we'll start with the structure you go through when analysing data
- then we'll work our way out to how you collaborate with others
- and then finally how these general workflows apply to teaching
- this part is going to be more discussion based - we'll have you dicuss what you do, and then I'll put forward best practices as per the people whose advice I follow within the R community

???
- Explain this
- We'll take 5 minutes for you in pairs to walk through what you actually do when you go through this process - be as concrete as possible! Where do you save your files? Do you use separate scripts for different parts of the analysis etc.? (after 2.5 minutes we swith)
- (get a couple of people to share what they do)
- now i'll annotate this and point you to some best practices

---
class: middle, larger-body
> One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later, perhaps months or years later...<br>


--
> One day you will need to hand an analysis over to someone else to critique, extend, or reuse...<br>


--
> To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

--
> - What about your analysis is "real", i.e. you will save it as your lasting record of what happened?

--

### Assignment submissions with R Markdown 

--
> For teaching statistics, I ask students to submit R Markdown files and a knitted version with echo = TRUE as a global option. <br>

--

.col-4.beginner[
Make a report from scratch, starting from **final_practical_beginner.Rmd** (this document has a chunk in the beginning with overall results and plots that you can drop in to the report if you're not familiar with R)

Add your name, today's date, an introduction with a few citations and an image, report some main results, cross reference something, then output to `bookdown::pdf_document2` and `bookdown::html_document2`
]
  
.col-4.intermediate[
1. Make a new R project, and create an R Markdown file with output customisation and sample content that would make it an appropriate template for students to use in a teaching situation relevant to you.
2. Look into https://rstudio.cloud and consider possible uses of it in a teaching situation relevant to you. 

]

.col-4.advanced[
1. Find out what the [Open Science Framework R package can do](https://centerforopenscience.github.io/osfr/), and suggest how it might be useful in a workflow relevant to you.
