# Code chunks

![](figures/chunk-parts.png)
--

**Some common chunk options** (see e.g. [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html))
- `echo`: whether or not to display code in knitted output
- `eval`: whether or to to run the code in the chunk when knitting
- `include`: wheter to include anything from the from a code chunk in the output document
- `fig.cap`: figure caption

---
class: larger-body
# Typical chunks
### Setup chunk
````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
# don't show code unless we explicitly set echo = TRUE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
```
````

--
- Normally, an R Markdown document starts with a chunk that's used to set some options and load required libraries.

--
- `knitr::opts_chunk$set` sets default options for all chunks.


---
### Including images

````markdown
`r ''````{r, fig.cap="R Markdown logo"}

    geom_point()

### Including tables

.pull-left[
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
cars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table")
```
````
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# cars is a built-in-to-R data set of cars
# and their stopping distances
cars %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html", caption = "A knitr kable table")
```

]

<br>

--
- Gotcha: when using [`kable`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.21/topics/kable), captions  are set inside the `kable` function
- The `kable` package is often used with the [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) package
- A number of other packages are available for making pretty tables, see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html)

---
class: larger-body
# Inline code

--
Inside your text you can include code with the syntax <span>&#96;</span>r code here&#96;.


--
For example, <span>&#96;</span>r 4 + 4&#96; would output `r 4 + 4` in your text.

--
```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(diamonds, n = 5)

num_diamonds <- nrow(diamonds)

```

--
.pull-left[
There are <span>&#96;</span>r num_diamonds&#96; rows in the `diamonds` dataset.
]

--
.pull-right[
There are `r num_diamonds` rows in the `diamonds` dataset.

# Inline code with python

--
[At the moment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47818461/is-there-a-way-in-knitr-to-evaluate-inline-code-chunks-of-other-languages), syntax like <span>&#96;</span>python code here&#96; is not valid.


--
However, you can use the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html) package to access variables from python chunks.

--
````markdown
`r ''````{python}
my_number = 4 + 8

print(my_number)

```
````

```{python}
my_number = 4 + 8
print(my_number)
```

--
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
library(reticulate)

py$my_number

```
````

```{r}
py$my_number
```

--
Inline you can then refer to this python variable with <span>&#96;</span>r py$my_number&#96; - `my_number` is `r py$my_number`.

You can add e.g `csl: my-style.csl` in the YAML header to change to other formats - browse through and download styles at [zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles)

# Citations
For an easy way to insert citations, try the [`citr`](https://github.com/crsh/citr) RStudio add-in.

.row[
  .col-4[
  `install.packages("citr")`
  ]
  
  .col-8[
  .center[
  ```{r, out.width="75%"}
  knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/citr/master/tools/images/addin_demo.gif")
  ```

# Cross-referencing
- The `bookdown` package adds capability to do cross-referencing. We can refer to **sections** within our document, to **figures** and **tables**, and even pieces of **text**.

--
- To enable this ability, set output to e.g. `bookdown::html_document2`, `bookdown::pdf_document2`, `bookdown::word_document2`, etc. (see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html))


--
```yaml
---
title: "Cross-referencing test"
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

---
class: larger-body
### Section references
- Headers are automatically assigned a reference label, which is the text in lower caps separated by dashes

--
  - For example, the label for `# My header` is `my-header`

--
- The cross-reference syntax is `\@ref(label)` 

--
  - So `# My header` can be referenced with `\@ref(my-section)`
  
--
  - .Rmd: `See section \@ref(my-header)` -> output: 'See section 1'
  
  
---
class: larger-body
### Section references
- You can also use hyperlink syntax and add \# before the label

--
  - .Rmd: `[see this section](#my-header)` -> output: '[see this section](#section-references)'

--
- Create custom labels by adding `{#label}` after a header, e.g. `# My section {#my-label}`.


--
Examples here: [Rmd file](https://github.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/blob/master/examples/cross_referencing.Rmd) and [HTML output](examples/cross_referencing.html).

## Figure and table references
- **GOTCHA**: Figures and tables must have captions if you wish to cross-reference them.

.pull-left[
````markdown
`r ''````{r captain, fig.cap="A marvel-lous meme"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/captain.jpeg")
```
````

```{r captain, fig.align='center', fig.cap="A marvel-lous meme", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/captain.jpeg")
```

]

--
.pull-right[
- To refer to figures (plots and images) use the syntax `\@ref(fig:label)`<sup>1</sup>
- So we'd refer to this image with `\@ref(fig:captain)`
- Again, examples here: [Rmd](https://github.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/blob/master/examples/cross_referencing.Rmd), [HTML](examples/cross-referencing.html)
]


--
.pull-right[
.footnote[
[1] Recall that the first chunk option after the language is the label (we could also be explicit with `label=captain`).

knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],

````

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],
            caption="Stopping cars")
```

]


--
.pull-right[
- To refer to tables use the syntax `\@ref(tab:label)`
- So we'd refer to this table with `\@ref(tab:cars)`
- ...examples here: [Rmd](https://github.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/blob/master/examples/cross_referencing.Rmd), [HTML](examples/cross-referencing.html)

.col-4.beginner[
1. Install the `citr` RStudio add-in
2. Open **examples/citation_test.Rmd** and add a new paragraph in which you use `citr` to add two citations - what happens when you knit?
3. Make cross-references to a figure and a table
]
  
.col-4.intermediate[
1. Open **examples/citation_test.Rmd** and change the citation style with `csl: citation_styles/apa.csl`. What happens when you knit?
2. Have a look through [zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles); download another styles and test it.
3. Add a custom label to a header and reference it
]

.col-4.advanced[
1. How do you stop pandoc from automatically inserting cited references by the end of the document?
2. How would you handle a situation where special characters made `fig.cap` mess up? (.black[[hint](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references)])
